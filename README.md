# tic-tac-toe
A Java implementation of tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 grid. The user gets to choose either the symbol 'X' or 'O' ('X' gets the first move) and then plays against an AI using a graphical user interface. The AI is based on the minimax algorithm.

I created this as my data structures course project in 2011. The game interface and source code are in Finnish.

**Compile:** javac Ristinolla.java
